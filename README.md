# Wildfires in Amazonas 2023
 Story about wildfires in Amazonas, from 2019 to 2023

This story contains some data analysis of the forest fires in the state of Amazonas from the years 2019 and 2023. And some thoughts on what the people from the area think about it. I have used the Terrabrasilis API to get the data needed to the construct the graphics on DataWrapper.

Through this project, my goal was to explore the forest fires that my parents experienced in Manaus, in October 2023. By creating pivot tables on excel, analysing the data, and explorinn the Terrabrasilis API, I was able to see which years had the most forest firest and deforestation in general. 

I found that while deforestation seems to have decreased by a lot, forest fires have remained just about the same - just with a shift in location. 

With the information I got mainly from http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/, I used their API to find out deforestation areas and used their database to create tables regarding forest fires years and locations, then creating on DataWrapper easy-to-read visualizations. 

In the future, I hope to explore other sources with more knowledge on forest fires and maybe spatial images for more accurate information.
